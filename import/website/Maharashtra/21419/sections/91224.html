The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out\r\nthe manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 2023.

A was never\r\ncharged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred\r\nexclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and\r\nthat the error in the charge was immaterial.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 2023, and Khoda Baksh (who\r\ntried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 2023. When charged for the murder of Haidar\r\nBaksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses\r\nin the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was\r\nmaterial.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<\/br>"}
