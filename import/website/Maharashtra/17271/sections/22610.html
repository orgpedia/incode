A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this\r\nthat the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many\r\ntransactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no\r\ndefence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a\r\nmaterial error.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was\r\nHaidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and\r\nhad heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer\r\nfrom these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him\r\nfor that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of\r\nKhoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from\r\nthis that A was misled, and that the error was material.<\/br>"}
