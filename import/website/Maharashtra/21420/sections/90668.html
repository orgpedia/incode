Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has\r\ncommitted theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\u2019s dog to follow it. Here, if A\u2019s intention\r\nbe dishonestly to take the dog out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent. A has committed theft as soon\r\nas Z\u2019s dog has begun to follow A.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order\r\nthat he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft\r\nof the treasure.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(d) A being Z\u2019s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\u2019s plate, dishonestly runs away with the\r\nplate, without Z\u2019s consent. A has committed theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A\r\ncarries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\u2019s possession. It could not therefore\r\nbe taken out of Z\u2019s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal\r\nbreach of trust.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z\u2019s\r\npossession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits\r\nno theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\u2019s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the\r\nring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly\r\nimprobable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and\r\nselling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the\r\njeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop\r\nopenly, takes his watch by force out of Z\u2019s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have\r\ncommitted criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done\r\ndishonestly.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for\r\nthe debt, and A takes the watch out of Z\u2019s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as\r\na security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, not\r\nhaving paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as\r\nmuch as he takes it dishonestly.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, with the intention of\r\nkeeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has\r\ntherefore committed theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\u2019s library in Z\u2019s absence, and takes away a book\r\nwithout Z\u2019s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it.\r\nHere, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z\u2019s implied consent to use Z\u2019s book. If this\r\nwas A\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(n) A asks charity from Z\u2019s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to\r\nZ her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z\u2019s wife is authorised to give away alms. If\r\nthis was A\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(o) A is the paramour of Z\u2019s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her\r\nhusband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property\r\ndishonestly, he commits theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\u2019s own property, takes that property out\r\nof Z\u2019s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term\r\nwhich may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second or subsequent\r\nconviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term\r\nwhich shall not be less than one year but which may extend to five years and with fine:<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>Provided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five thousand rupees,\r\nand a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value of property or restoration of the\r\nstolen property, shall be punished with community service.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<\/br>"}
