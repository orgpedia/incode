Here, as A\r\ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B,\r\nand thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(f) Z\u2019s will contains these words\u2014\"I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided\r\nbetween A, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B\u2019s name, intending that it may be believed that the\r\nwhole was left to himself and C.

A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper\r\npursuant to A\u2019s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name.
