{"footnote":"<\/br>\t\t","content":"<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(1) When any person not under twenty-one years of age is convicted of an offence punishable with fine only or with imprisonment for a term of\r\nseven years or less, or when any person under twenty-one years of age or any woman is convicted of an offence not\r\npunishable with death or imprisonment for life, and no previous conviction is proved against the offender, if it\r\nappears to the Court before which he is convicted, regard being had to the age, character or antecedents of the\r\noffender, and to the circumstances in which the offence was committed, that it is expedient that the offender should\r\nbe released on probation of good conduct, the Court may, instead of sentencing him at once to any punishment,\r\ndirect that he be released on his entering into a bond, with or without sureties, to appear and receive sentence when\r\ncalled upon during such period (not exceeding three years) as the Court may direct, and in the meantime to keep the\r\npeace and be of good behaviour:<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>Provided that where any first offender is convicted by a Magistrate of the second class not specially empowered\r\nby the High Court, and the Magistrate is of opinion that the powers conferred by this section should be exercised, he\r\nshall record his opinion to that effect, and submit the proceedings to a Magistrate of the first class, forwarding the\r\naccused to, or taking bail for his appearance before, such Magistrate, who shall dispose of the case in the manner\r\nprovided by sub-section (2).<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(2) Where proceedings are submitted to a Magistrate of the first class as provided by sub-section (1), such Magistrate\r\nmay thereupon pass such sentence or make such order as he might have passed or made if the case had originally been\r\nheard by him, and, if he thinks further inquiry or additional evidence on any point to be necessary, he may make such\r\ninquiry or take such evidence himself or direct such inquiry or evidence to be made or taken.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(3) In any case in which a person is convicted of theft, theft in a building, dishonest misappropriation, cheating\r\nor any offence under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), punishable with not more than two years, imprisonment or\r\nany offence punishable with fine only and no previous conviction is proved against him, the Court before which he\r\nis so convicted may, if it thinks fit, having regard to the age, character, antecedents or physical or mental condition\r\nof the offender and to the trivial nature of the offence or any extenuating circumstances under which the offence was\r\ncommitted, instead of sentencing him to any punishment, release him after due admonition.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(4) An order under this section may be made by any Appellate Court or by the High Court or Court of Session\r\nwhen exercising its powers of revision.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(5) When an order has been made under this section in respect of any offender, the High Court or Court of\r\nSession may, on appeal when there is a right of appeal to such Court, or when exercising its powers of revision, set\r\naside such order, and in lieu thereof pass sentence on such offender according to law:<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>Provided that the High Court or Court of Session shall not under this sub-section

section.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(7) The Court, before directing the release of an offender under sub-section (1), shall be satisfied that an\r\noffender

of the conditions.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(8) If the Court which convicted the offender, or a Court which could have dealt with the offender in respect of\r\nhis original offence, is satisfied that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of his recognizance, it\r\nmay issue a warrant for his apprehension.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(9) An offender, when apprehended on any such warrant, shall be brought forthwith before the Court issuing the\r\nwarrant, and such Court may either remand him in custody until the case is heard or admit him to bail with a\r\nsufficient surety conditioned on his appearing for sentence and such Court may, after hearing the case, pass\r\nsentence.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(10) Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 (20 of 1958),
