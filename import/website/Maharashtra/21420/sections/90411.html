Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act\r\nwhich causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby\r\ncauses Z's death. Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be\r\npunished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had\r\ncommitted murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness of mind,\r\nbeing incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets\r\nfire to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of\r\nabetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that\r\noffence.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of\r\nZ's possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's\r\npossession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property. B, acting under this misconception, does not\r\ntake dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the\r\nsame punishment as if B had committed theft.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><i>Explanation<\/i> 4.---The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is\r\nalso an offence.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<center class=\"font1\"><i>Illustration<\/i>.<\/center><\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that\r\noffence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment\r\nfor murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span><i>Explanation<\/i> 5.---It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that\r\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it.

It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then\r\nexplains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being\r\nused in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C\r\nhave not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been\r\nmurdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment\r\nfor murder.<\/br><hr class=\"hr1\"/><\/br>"}
