Upon such request, the State Government may, by notification in the <i>Official Gazette<\/i>, direct that such institution shall, from such date and subject to such terms and conditions (including those relating to the employees serving therein or thereunder) as may be specified in the notification, cease to vest in the University and pass to, and be maintained by, the State Government; and thereupon all properties and assets and liabilities of the University in relation to such institution shall stand transferred to, and vest in, the State Government. The conditions of service of the employees, if any, transferred to the State Government along with the institution shall not be less favourable than those applicable to them immediately before such transfer. <\/br>"}
