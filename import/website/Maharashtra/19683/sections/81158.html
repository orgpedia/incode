{"footnote":"<\/br>\t\t","content":"<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><\/span>The Registrar General may, <i>suo motu<\/i> or on an application, call for and examine the record of any enquiry or proceedings of any matter where the order has been passed or decision has been given by an officer subordinate to him, and no appeal lies against such decision or order for the purpose of satisfying himself as to the legality and propriety of the decision or order and as to the regularity of the proceedings. If during the course of such inquiry, the Registrar General is satisfied that the decision or order so called for should be modified, annulled or reversed, he may, after giving a person likely to be affected thereby an opportunity of being heard, pass such order thereon as he may seem just. <\/br>"}
